This is a plugin to add auth stack for your projects.

To add this to your claude code

```sh
#Run claude
/plugin marketplace add saif-at-scalekit/claude-code-authstack
```

1. This installs the plugin to your claude code.
2. Run `/plugin` and navigate right.
3. You should see couple of plugins listed; scalekit will treat `scalekit-auth-stack` as a marketplace.
4. Select them and install. (not sure why, but it takes couple of restarts or about 20 mins to show up in the list)
5. When you run time Claude will take you through a wizard.

Once installed, you can:

- Use the **Scalekit dryrun Skill** to validate your Scalekit auth configuration from Claude Code.  
  See `specs/001-scalekit-dryrun-skill/quickstart.md` for a guided workflow.
